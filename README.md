# justgage-npm-sample

A sample webpage built with [Browserify](https://www.npmjs.com/package/browserify) to incorporate the [JustGage](https://www.npmjs.com/package/justgage) npm package.

**JustGage** is described as:
> A handy JavaScript plugin for generating and animating nice & clean dashboard gauges. It is based on Raphaël library for vector drawing.

**Browserify** is described as:
> Browserify is a development tool that allows us to write node.js-style modules that compile for use in the browser. Just like node, we write our modules in separate files, exporting external methods and properties using the module.exports and exports variables. We can even require other modules using the require function, and if we omit the relative path it’ll resolve to the module in the node_modules directory.
